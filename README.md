# Model Comparison on the Mobile Pricing Classification Dataset
"Explain the code base and the functionality of the modules"
In this repository we will investigate the patterns of this dataset. The 4 models we will use:

- Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- KNN


The 4 classes in this task Price ranges in the dataset and are the following:
0 - low cost
1 - medium cost
2 - high cost
3 - very high cost

## Libraries we haved used
In this project we have used the following Python libraries:
- Numpy (For mathematical calculations for the data)
- Matplotlib (For visualisation of the dataset)
- Seaborn (Additional visualisation)
- Pandas (For helping to manipulate the dataset in a reliable way)
- Time (For duration of model calculations)
- sklearn (For the 2 models outside of lectures)
- Scipy (For Softmax Regression model)
- sys (For the main Python file to run the experiments)
- metrics (Our own local library, where we have reconstructed the metrics for multi-class classification problems)



## Interface instructions for Each Model

Main command for plots and results
 python main.py MobilePricingUpdated.csv

## Reproducing the results (duration of the runtime)
"max 15 to do all the running"
"specify the randomness seed etc"
