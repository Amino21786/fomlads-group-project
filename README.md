# Model Comparison on the Income Evaluation Dataset
"Explain the code base and the functionality of the modules"
In this repository we will investigate the patterns of this dataset. The 4 models we will use:

- Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Logistic Regression or Shared Covariance Model
- Random Forest Classifier
- ?







## Libraries we haved used
This will be the list of libraries we will use


## Interface instructions for Each Model
"Will be 4 models here and for each one will give the commands to run it 

# python main.py <DATA FILE> <COMMAND LINE OPTIONS/FLAGS>

## Reproducing the results (duration of the runtime)
"max 15 to do all the running"
"specify the randomness seed etc"
