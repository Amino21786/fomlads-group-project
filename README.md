# Model Comparison on the Rain in Australia Dataset
"Explain the code base and the functionality of the modules"
In this repository we will investigate the patterns of this dataset. The 4 models we will use:

- Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Knn


## Report

**abstract**-most of it done
**Introduction**- need to comment on the algorithms


## Problems with overleaf:

1. I can't make it **cite a wikipedia page**, I followed the indications here: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CiteThisPage&page=2019%E2%80%9320_Australian_bushfire_season&id=1013926199&wpFormIdentifier=titleform , but I cannot make it work, because the link contains a "%" which is considered by overleaf as comment symbol.







## Libraries we haved used
This will be the list of libraries we will use


## Interface instructions for Each Model
"Will be 4 models here and for each one will give the commands to run it 

# python main.py <DATA FILE> <COMMAND LINE OPTIONS/FLAGS>

## Reproducing the results (duration of the runtime)
"max 15 to do all the running"
"specify the randomness seed etc"
