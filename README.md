# Model Comparison on the Mobile Pricing Classification Dataset
"Explain the code base and the functionality of the modules"
In this repository we will investigate the patterns of this dataset. The 4 models we will use:

- Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- KNN



## Report Checklist
Price Ranges for Classification:
0 - low cost
1 - medium cost
2 - high cost
3 - very high cost
**abstract and Intro (5 marks)**-
**Background (5 marks)**- 
**Dataset (10 marks)**-
**Method (15 marks)**-
**Results, Experiments, Evaluation (15 marks)**-
**Discussion (5 marks)**- Could talk about how there so many companies competing now with the price ranges, where only like 5 years ago there were only like 2 ranges (cheap and high end), but then iPhone X 999 dollars price increased the range and now there are many companies trying to get into the market (Samsung, ASUS, OnePlus etc)
Also about new quirky concepts too with foldable and different features like LG Wing


## Problems with overleaf:
from rain in australia
1. I can't make it **cite a wikipedia page**, I followed the indications here: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CiteThisPage&page=2019%E2%80%9320_Australian_bushfire_season&id=1013926199&wpFormIdentifier=titleform , but I cannot make it work, because the link contains a "%" which is considered by overleaf as comment symbol.

## Libraries we haved used
This will be the list of libraries we will use


## Interface instructions for Each Model
"Will be 4 models here and for each one will give the commands to run it 
Example of command
 python main.py <DATA FILE> <COMMAND LINE OPTIONS/FLAGS>

## Reproducing the results (duration of the runtime)
"max 15 to do all the running"
"specify the randomness seed etc"
